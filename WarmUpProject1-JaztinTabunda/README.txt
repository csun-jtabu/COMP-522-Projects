Warm-Up Project 1 - Potentiometer
COMP 522 - V. Bhatt
2-5-2023

Besides Research on this Project, Steps I took:

1. Connected Arduino UNO to Laptop. This allowed power to flow from my laptop to the 
Arduino board
2. Plugged Potentiometer onto BreadBoard
3. Used Red Jumper wire to connect 5v pin from Arduino to the first leg of the Potentiometer
on the Breadboard
4. Used Black Jumper wire to connect ground pin from Arduino to the second leg of the 
Potentiometer on the Breadboard
5. Used White Jumper wire to connect A0 pin from Arduino to the third individual leg of the 
Potentiometer on the Breadboard
6. Plugged LED onto Breadboard
7. Used Blue Jumper wire to connect from digital input PWM pin ~6 to the Breadboard
8. Used 220 Ohm Resistor to connect from Blue Jumper wire on the Breadboard to positive
terminal of LED on Breadboard
9. Used Black Jumper wire to connect ground pin from Arduino to the negative terminal of LED
on Breadboard
10. Tested Potentiometer by using Serial.Print();
11. Potentiometer works so Tested LED if circuit wiring turns the LED on
12. LED turns on with circuit wiring
13. Wrote the program, compiled, and tested

How much of the Project is working:
Project is Finished. The Program can change the brightness of an LED using a Potentiometer
