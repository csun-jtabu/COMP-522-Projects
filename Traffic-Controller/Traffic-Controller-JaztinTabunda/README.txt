Besides Research on this Project, Steps I took:

1. Connected Arduino UNO to Laptop. This allowed power to flow from my laptop to the 
Arduino board
2. Plugged Red, Yellow, and Green LEDS into Breadboard
3. Connected Jumper cables to each corresponding pins stated in code
(Also connected 5v to breadboard and Ground)
4. Connected the other ends of the Jumper cables to the board
5. Connected resistors near each corresponding jumper cable
6. Connected the resistors to the anodes of each led
7. Plugged more jumper cables to the Cathode and ground on the breadboard
8. Wrote the program, compiled, and tested

How much of the Project is working:
Project is Finished. The Program automatically alternates to different states.
As far as I know, there is no need to put interrupts or debouncing because we don't
use any inputs/buttons
